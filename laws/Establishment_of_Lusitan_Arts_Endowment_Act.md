# Establishment of Lusitan Arts Endowment Act

WHEREAS, the great artistic endeavors in Lusitania have been largely unrecognized beyond the nation's borders
WHEREAS, the domestic market for literature and visual arts beyond map-painting is greatly lessened in output as a result of few economic incentives
WHEREAS, it is the duty of a responsible government to encourage the cultural flourishing of the nation as a whole, and the prosperity of individuals included therein

The office of Prime Minister proposes the following new law to be enacted within Lusitania's borders:

* The establishment of a fund (Hereafter to be referred to as the Lusitan Arts Endowment), initially consisting of no less than 10 diamonds, in addition to future donations from charitable citizenry, to be stewarded by the office of Prime Minister, Royal Family, and other individuals specifically and publicly authorized by the Prime Minister or Royal Family to handle the withdrawing from and depositing into the Lusitan Arts Endowment. These individuals will be listed in a place where such information will be accessible to all citizens.
* The fund can only be used to pay for the following works made by Lusitan citizens, at prices of one or more diamonds in addition to other donated items at the discretion of the Prime Minister, Royal Family, or the aforementioned authorized individuals:
    * Commissioned works of visual arts including, but not limited to: in-game sculpture and statuary, map art, and performances of play or dance.
      * Commissioned works of literature including but not limited to: poetry, songs, fiction, nonfiction, and non-narrative fiction.
      * Payments for contests accepting works of literature or visual arts from non-citizens, subject to approval by the Office of Prime Minister, the Royal Family, or other individuals authorized to handle the Lusitan Arts Endowment.
* Upon purchase of these works, the Office of Prime Minister and the Royal Family retain rights to an original copy, and are able to reproduce and sell the works if the original artist is given credit consistinng of explicit mention of the In-game-name. Proceeds from selling the works accquired in this manner are only to be paid back into the fund. This does not apply to the original artist, who is also able to reproduce and sell their work as they see fit.

I must admit to something humbling, fellow Lusitans and Friends born abroad. I have endeavored to cover every base with this law, and worry that this has muddied the waters. But despite the denseness and legalese, I should hope that the heart of the matter shines through: that I desire to provide artists compensation from the Lusitan government, and minimize corruption such a fund's existence could potentially bring. If the law should be found wanting, strike it down, but do be sure to state your case. I aim to find an amicable solution for this problem, and all input to that end is thus a treasure worth cherishing.

May Peace and Amity Prevail,
Passencore
Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Lusitania
