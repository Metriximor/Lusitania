# The Invasive Species Act

WHEREAS, it has long been acknowledged and evident that the species known as the Greater CIVMC Poultryfowl, hereafter referred to as "Chicken", is a latecoming arrival to Lusitania.
WHEREAS, it has long been acknowledged and evident that the aforementioned species is outcompeting native fauna and spreading unchecked across the plains and hills of our great nation
WHEREAS, this represents an avenue of ecological catastrophe if not rectified.

The office of Prime Minister promulgates the following new law to be enacted within Lusitania's borders:

* Breeding of new chickens within 64 blocks of any municipal area is outlawed until November 23, 2025 at which point this restriction will be reviewed.
* A license is required for all those who would keep a chicken on their property, to be issued by the Prime Minister or by individuals directly approved by the Office of Prime Minister or the Royal Family. Pets registered in this manner are considered inviolate property, not eligible for slaughter or release. Chickens freely roaming in the open air are to be considered "fair game" for capture and/or slaughter.
* A bounty of 5 iron nuggets is to be paid for every 16 cooked chickens, payable upon verification of said 16 cooked chickens by the Prime Minister, or other individuals approved by the Prime Minister.
* Those caught breaking eggs, breeding chickens, or otherwise violating the terms of this law will be fined two iron ingots per infraction.

I would not promulgate this law were it not for the dire state of our streets, and the peril of our native ecosystems. I recognize the measure may seem extreme, but I hope that you see it as I do: unfortunate, but necessary. 

Peace and Amity Prevail,
PM Passencore
